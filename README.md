## Notes:
- Used compiler version `0.8.28` as it is newer than the requested `0.8.24`

## Part C Questions:
1. Tx 1 landed first
2. Tx 3 had higher effective price (Tx 1 was second highest), while Tx 2 had highest priority tip
3. EIP-559 was a change to Ethereum's network transaction fee processing. Originally the gas fee was set by highest-bidder (which made transactions on high-traffic networks expensive). With EIP-559 transaction fees are now the same for everyone on the network, calculated as base (calculated based on actual network traffic) + tip (a priority fee to expedite transactions).
